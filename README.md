# Spotify ETL Pipeline on AWS

## Overview
This ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline processes data from the Spotify API and makes it available for analysis using AWS services. The architecture is designed to be scalable, fault-tolerant, and cost-effective, leveraging various AWS managed services to automate and optimize data processing.

## Architecture

![Spotify Pipeline Architecture](https://github.com/anupamjha977/Spotify_Etl_Project/blob/main/spotify_pipeline-architecture.png)

The diagram illustrates the following data flow:

### Data Extraction:
- The pipeline starts with the **Spotify API** as the data source.
- An **AWS Lambda** function, triggered on a schedule (e.g., daily) by **Amazon CloudWatch**, extracts raw data from the Spotify API.
- The extracted raw data is stored in **Amazon S3** in its raw format.

### Data Transformation:
- Upon the arrival of new raw data in S3, an S3 trigger invokes another **AWS Lambda** function.
- This Lambda function reads the raw data, performs necessary transformations (cleaning, filtering, aggregating, etc.), and writes the transformed data back to a different location in Amazon S3.

### Data Loading and Cataloging:
- An **AWS Glue Crawler** is used to crawl the transformed data in S3.
- The Glue Crawler infers the schema of the transformed data and creates or updates metadata in the **AWS Glue Data Catalog**.
- AWS Glue Data Catalog serves as a central repository for metadata, making it easy to query and analyze the data.

### Data Analysis:
- **Amazon Athena**, a serverless query service, is used to analyze the transformed data.
- Users can use SQL queries in Athena to gain insights from the Spotify data.

## Components
- **Spotify API**: The source of the data.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Used to schedule the data extraction process.
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute service used for data extraction and transformation.
- **Amazon S3**: Scalable storage for raw and transformed data.
- **AWS Glue Crawler**: Automatically discovers the schema of data in S3 and populates the Glue Data Catalog.
- **AWS Glue Data Catalog**: A central metadata repository.
- **Amazon Athena**: Serverless SQL query service to analyze data.

## Key Considerations
- **Scalability**: Lambda and S3 can scale to handle large volumes of data. Athena is also highly scalable.
- **Cost-effectiveness**: The serverless nature of Lambda and Athena helps to optimize costs, as you only pay for what you use. S3 provides cost-effective storage.
- **Fault Tolerance**: AWS services are designed to be highly available and fault-tolerant.
- **Automation**: The pipeline is automated using CloudWatch and S3 triggers.
- **Data Quality**: The transformation step in Lambda is crucial for ensuring data quality.
- **Schema Evolution**: Glue Crawler can handle schema changes in the data over time.
- **Security**: Appropriate IAM roles and permissions should be configured for all AWS services to ensure data security.

## Conclusion
This Spotify ETL pipeline efficiently extracts, transforms, and loads Spotify data into a format suitable for analysis. By leveraging AWS services such as Lambda, S3, Glue, and Athena, the pipeline is designed to be cost-effective, scalable, and fault-tolerant.
